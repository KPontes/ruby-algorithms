# README
# ruby-algorithms
This is a broad algorithm study, with my solutions for algorithmic questions from a variety of source sites, 
as codility, geeksforgeeks and others.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
